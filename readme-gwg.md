# Gemini enhanced prompt

"I have developed SPL (Structured Prompt Language), which is syntactically modeled after SQL. Using the EBNF grammar in @/home/wengong/projects/digital-duck/SPL/docs/grammar.ebnf as the source of truth, generate a tmLanguage.json file for a VS Code extension.

Requirements:

SQL-Parallel Highlighting: Map keywords to their closest SQL equivalents.

SELECT, FROM, WITH, AS, LIMIT: use keyword.control.sql.

PROMPT, GENERATE: use keyword.other.DML.sql (to treat them as primary actions).

WITH BUDGET: treat this as a single logical keyword (handle the space).

Scope Mapping:

Built-in Functions: rag(), memory(), context() should use support.function.builtin.

Numbers/Tokens: Numbers following LIMIT or BUDGET should use constant.numeric.

Model Names: Strings following USING MODEL should use entity.name.type or variable.other.

Comments: Include support for SQL-style comments (-- comment and /* block */).

Strings: Handle double-quoted strings with escape characters.

Output Format: Provide the full JSON structure with scopeName: source.spl."
```

## Steps to Build SPL-LLM VS Code Extension (Syntax Highlighting)

Now that you have created the `tmLanguage.json` file for SPL syntax highlighting, here are the next steps to build and run your VS Code extension:

1.  **Generate the Extension Project:**
    *   Install Yeoman and the VS Code Extension Generator (if you haven't already):
        ```bash
        npm install -g yo generator-code
        ```
    *   Run the Yeoman generator:
        ```bash
        yo code
        ```
    *   When prompted, select "New Language Support".
    *   Follow the prompts to enter details like the language name (e.g., "SPL"), language ID ("spl"), file extension (e.g., ".spl"), etc. This will scaffold a complete VS Code extension project.

2.  **Integrate Your `tmLanguage.json` File:**
    *   Navigate into the newly created extension project directory.
    *   Copy your `tmLanguage.json` file (which you previously generated) into the `syntaxes` directory of your new project. You will likely be overwriting a placeholder grammar file generated by `yo code`.

3.  **Configure `package.json`:**
    *   Open the `package.json` file at the root of your new extension project.
    *   Review the `contributes.languages` and `contributes.grammars` sections. Ensure they correctly point to your `tmLanguage.json` file and define the language ID (`spl`), scope name (`source.spl`), and file extensions (`.spl`). The `yo code` generator should have set most of this up correctly, but it's good to double-check.

    Example `package.json` snippet (ensure paths match your project structure):
    ```json
    {
      // ... other package.json fields
      "contributes": {
        "languages": [{
          "id": "spl",
          "aliases": ["SPL", "Structured Prompt Language"],
          "extensions": [".spl"],
          "configuration": "./language-configuration.json"
        }],
        "grammars": [{
          "language": "spl",
          "scopeName": "source.spl",
          "path": "./syntaxes/tmLanguage.json"
        }]
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

4.  **Test Your Extension:**
    *   Open your extension project in VS Code.
    *   Press `F5` to launch a new "Extension Development Host" window. This window will have your extension loaded.
    *   In the "Extension Development Host" window, create a new file (e.g., `test.spl`) and paste some SPL code into it.
    *   Verify that your syntax highlighting is applied correctly.

5.  **Package Your Extension and Alternative Testing Method:**
    *   **Troubleshooting `vsce package`:** You encountered an error: `"ERROR Make sure to edit the README.md file before you package or publish your extension."` This means the `vsce` tool requires the `README.md` file within your `spl-llm` extension project to contain meaningful content beyond the auto-generated template. I will update that `README.md` in the next step.
    *   **Packaging:** Once the `README.md` is updated, you can package your extension into a `.vsix` file for distribution:
        ```bash
        npm install -g vsce
        vsce package
        ```
        This will create a `.vsix` file (e.g., `spl-llm-0.0.1.vsix`) in your project directory.
    *   **Alternative Testing (Manual `.vsix` Installation):** If you are unable to launch the Extension Development Host using F5, you can test your syntax highlighting by manually installing the `.vsix` file:
        *   Open your regular VS Code instance (not the development host).
        *   Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
        *   Click on the `...` (More Actions) menu in the top-right corner of the Extensions panel.
        *   Select "Install from VSIX..."
        *   Browse to and select the `.vsix` file you just created.
        *   VS Code will prompt you to reload. Click "Reload Window".
        *   Open any of your sample `.spl` scripts from the `sample-spl-scripts` directory (e.g., `/home/wengong/projects/digital-duck/SPL-LLM/spl-llm/sample-spl-scripts`) and verify that your syntax highlighting is applied correctly.
    *   **Important Note:** This manual `.vsix` installation is a quick way to check syntax highlighting. However, for a proper development workflow, including debugging and testing other extension features, it's highly recommended to troubleshoot and fix the issue preventing F5 from working. If you'd like me to help troubleshoot why F5 isn't launching the host window, please let me know.

6.  **Publish Your Extension (Optional):**
    If you wish to share your extension with others by publishing it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, follow these steps. Please note that publishing requires some prerequisites and a more detailed setup than covered here.

    *   **Prerequisites:**
        *   An Azure DevOps Organization.
        *   A Personal Access Token (PAT) with "Marketplace (Publish)" scope.
        *   A Publisher ID registered with the VS Code Marketplace.

    *   **Publishing Command:**
        Once you have your publisher setup and PAT, you can publish your extension from your project directory:
        ```bash
        vsce publish
        ```
        This command will prompt you for your Personal Access Token.

    *   **For Detailed Instructions:**
        The official VS Code documentation provides comprehensive, up-to-date instructions on how to set up a publisher, obtain a Personal Access Token, and publish your extension to the Marketplace:
