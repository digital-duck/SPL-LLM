-- Showcase: 2 most recent papers by prize winners in Physics, Math, and CS
-- (Nobel Prize / Fields Medal / Turing Award, last 5 years: 2020-2025)
--
-- Design notes:
--   • Three PROMPT statements — one per domain, clean per-domain output
--   • USING MODEL auto — MoM routing assigns each to its strongest specialist
--   • TEMPERATURE 0.1 — low temp reduces hallucination on factual queries
--   • System role instructs the model to admit uncertainty rather than guess
--     (key signal: which model is honest vs. which fabricates confidently)
--
-- Run against a single model:
